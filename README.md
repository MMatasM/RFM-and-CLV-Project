# RFM-and-CLV-Project
An ecommerce store's RFM and CLV analysis
Objective:
The task involved refining the calculation of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for an e-commerce site, moving beyond the simplistic Shopify formula to a more robust, cohort-based approach. The analysis aimed to include all site visitors, not just purchasers, and provide a comprehensive weekly cohort analysis to better understand revenue trends.

Approach and Tools Used:
Data Extraction with SQL: Developed SQL queries to pull data on weekly revenue divided by the number of registrations (first site visits). Focused on extracting accurate user counts by weekly cohorts and calculating main metrics like revenue and orders.
Cohort Analysis & Visualization: Implemented cohort analysis to track revenue growth over time for different user groups. Used Google Sheets for visualization, applying conditional formatting to effectively display the data.
Predictive Analysis for Future Cohorts: Extended the analysis to predict future revenue for newer cohorts, using average cumulative growth rates.
Key Insights and Findings:
Demonstrated how including all users, not just those who made a purchase, affects the calculation of CLV.
Provided a week-by-week view of user engagement and spending, highlighting trends in user behavior over their lifecycle.
Predicted future revenue for newer cohorts, giving insights into expected CLV.
Challenges and Further Analysis:
Addressed the limitations of the cohort analysis and the impact of various factors like the business's Take Rate.
Suggested comparison against customer acquisition costs and the potential caveats of this approach.
Conclusions:
This project showcases my ability to conduct complex, nuanced analyses of CLV using advanced SQL and data visualization techniques. It highlights my understanding of the importance of cohort analysis in predicting future revenue and refining CLV calculations, making it an essential asset for strategic business decision-making.
